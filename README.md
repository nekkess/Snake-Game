# Snake-Game

This is the classic snake video game which you might remember from your first Nokia. 
Created using Python, OOP & the turtle module. 
Use the Up, Down, Left & Right keys to move the snake, eat the fruits and don't crash.
The code writes down the highest score and saves it in a txt file.
Try beating my highscore!
